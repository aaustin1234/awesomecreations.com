                    <p>As a Lead Software Test Engineer at Pathful, formerly Strivven Media, 
                        I oversaw the quality assurance and documentation of the company's suite of college and career readiness platforms. 
                        I have been working in this role for over three years, with a total of more than twenty years of experience in technology, 
                        including software development, manufacturing, operations, and R&D environments.
                    </p>
                    <p>My core competencies include software testing, cybersecurity policy, documentation, web development, and technical publications. 
                        I am passionate about creating user-friendly and secure solutions that enhance the learning and career development of students 
                        and professionals. I also enjoy collaborating with cross-functional teams, designing and implementing best practices, 
                        and mentoring junior staff. My goal is to continuously improve my skills and knowledge in the fields of software testing 
                        and cybersecurity.</p>
